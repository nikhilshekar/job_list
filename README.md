# Job List mobile app
This is React Native app where users will be presented with a top navigation UI with “Jobs” and “Bookmarks” as the sections. The Jobs screen should fetch data from the  API in an infinite scroll approach. Clicking on a Job card should show more details related to it on another screen.
